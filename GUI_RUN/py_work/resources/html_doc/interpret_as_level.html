    <p class="p">If <span style="" class="text typewriter">interpret_as_level wc</span> is defined, a <span style="" class="text typewriter">wc_file</span> would be interpreted as

  <pre class="verbatim">
	#      z     LWC    R\_eff
	#     (km)  (g/m^3) (um)
	       5.000    0      0

	       2.000   0.1    8.0
	
</pre>
    <p class="p">The value 0.2 g/m<img src="mi/mi1.png" width="14" height="24" alt="{}^{3}" class="math"> refers to altitude 4.0km, as e.g. in a
radiosonde profile. The properties of each layer are calculated as
average over the adjacent levels. E.g. the single scattering
properties for the model layer between 3 and 4km are obtained by
averaging over the two levels 3km and 4km. To allow easy definition of
sharp cloud boundaries, clouds are only formed if both liquid water
contents above and below the respective layer are larger than
0. Hence, in the above example, the layers between 2 and 3 as well as
between 3 and 4km are cloudy while those between 1 and 2km and between
4 and 5km are not.</p>

  <div class="para" id="">
    <p class="p">Note that since version 1.4 the default is to interpret profile properties as
layer properties. For example wc properties are assumed to be constant over the layer.
The layer reaches from the level, where the properties are defined in the
<span style="" class="text typewriter">wc_file</span> to the level above that one.  The following lines</p>
