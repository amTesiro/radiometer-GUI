    <p class="p">With the option <span style="" class="text typewriter">tipa dirdiff</span>, the tilted independent
pixel (column) approximation (TIPA, the same as TICA) is carried out,
where a 3D-cloud file serves as input and the columns are tilted
towards the sun (see, e.g., Wapler and Mayer, 2008).  <span style="" class="text typewriter">tipa
dirdiff</span> works with all 1D-rte-solvers.  When choosing
tipa (<span style="" class="text typewriter">tipa dir</span>), from the ”tilted clouds” only the optical
depth for the calculation of the direct radiation is derived and used
later to calculate the diffuse radiation. To calculate the diffuse
radiation, the original cloud-matrix is still necessary /
maintained. <span style="" class="text typewriter">tipa dir</span> works only with Roberts (Buras)
delta–Eddington two–stream model <span style="" class="text typewriter">rodents</span>.  For both tipa
options, a <span style="" class="text typewriter">mc_sample_grid</span> has to be specified as Nx Ny dx dy. A
3d-cloud-file (with flag 3) serves as input (see
<span style="" class="text typewriter">wc_file 3D</span>). The output is written into mc.flx(.spc),
however, a basename via <span style="" class="text typewriter">mc_basename</span> can be given.</p>
