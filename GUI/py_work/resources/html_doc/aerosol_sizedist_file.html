    <p class="p">Aerosol size distribution. Two columns are expected: The radius
[micrometer] and the particle number. Together with <span style="" class="text typewriter">aerosol_refrac_index</span> or
<span style="" class="text typewriter">aerosol_refrac_file</span> this forms the input to Mie calculations of the
aerosol optical properties. Please note that
only the single-scattering albedo, the scattering phase function, and the
wavelength-dependence of the extinction coefficient are affected by the Mie calculation
while the absolute value of the extinction coefficient is taken from other sources;
generally, the extinction coefficient at the first <em class="emph">internal</em> wavelength is
taken from whatever is available (either default <span style="" class="text typewriter">shettle89</span> or user-defined);
the extinction at all other wavelengths is scaled according to the Mie calculation.
For this reason, the absolute numbers are not relevant - only the shape of the
size distribution matters. For details see also the description of <span style="" class="text typewriter">aerosol_refrac_file</span>.
<em class="emph">It is recommended to avoid this option and rather to calculate the aerosol optical
properties externally e.g. with mie and to pass them to <span style="" class="text typewriter">uvspec</span> with
<span style="" class="text typewriter">aerosol_files</span></em>.</p>
